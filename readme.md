RADChat
=======================
This is an example of a Rapid-Developed-Chat-Application which was written for a presentation.
The implementation of this app took no longer than 30 minutes from zero to 100% and it shows,
how easy it is to implement a Basic Web-Application in little time and with only a few lines of code.

The used technologies are **NodeJS** and **AngularJS**.
The used frameworks and library are **expressJS** and **body-parser** for the server as well as **twitter bootstrap** for the 
client. See the Installation Guide for more information.
